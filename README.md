# CorbeauSplat v1.0.0

**CorbeauSplat** is an all-in-one Gaussian Splatting automation tool designed specifically for **macOS Silicon**. It streamlines the entire workflow from raw video/images to a fully trained and viewable 3D scene (Gaussian Splat).

> 🎉 **v1.0.0 — First Stable Release**  
> After extensive security hardening, architectural refactoring, and 200+ unit tests.

## 🚀 What it does

This application provides a unified Graphical User Interface (GUI) to orchestrate the following steps:
1.  **Project Management**: Automatically organizes your outputs into structured project folders with images, sparse data, and checkpoints.
2.  **Sparse Reconstruction**: Automates **COLMAP** feature extraction, matching, and mapping. Supports **Glomap** as a modern alternative mapper.
3.  **Undistortion**: Automatically undistorts images for optimal training quality.
4.  **AI Upscaling**: Optionally enhances input images before reconstruction using **upscayl-ncnn** — a fast NCNN-based upscaler with 6 curated models (Real-ESRGAN x4+, 4xLSDIR, 4xNomos8kSC, and more). Installed automatically at first launch.
5.  **Training**: Integrates **Brush** to train Gaussian Splats directly on your Mac.
6.  **Visualization**: Includes a built-in tab running **SuperSplat** for immediate local viewing and editing of your PLY files.
7.  **ML Sharp (Image/Video to 3D)**: Uses **Apple ML Sharp** to generate a 3D model from a single image or a sequence of 3D models directly from a video.
8.  **4DGS Preparation (Experimental)**: A new module to prepare 4D Gaussian Splatting datasets (Multi-camera video -> Nerfstudio format).
9.  **360 Extractor (Experimental)**: Converts equirectangular 360° videos into optimal planar image sets (Cube Map, Ring, etc.) for photogrammetry, with AI operator masking.

It is designed to be "click-and-run", handling dependency checks, process management, and **session persistence** for you.
It also includes built-in full localization support for **French, English, German, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese**.

## ✍️ A Note from the Author

> This program was realized through **"vibecoding"** with the help of **Gemini 3 Pro**.
>
> It was originally created to facilitate the technical workflow for a documentary film titled **"Le Corbeau"**. I am not a professional developer; I simply needed to automate a complex process by gathering the tools I use daily: COLMAP, the Brush app, and SuperSplat. 
>
> I share this code in all humility. I didn't originally plan to release it, but I thought that perhaps someone, somewhere on this earth, might find it useful.
>
> As this software was built via "vibecoding" (AI-assisted coding), it is provided "as is" with no guarantees.

## 🛠 Prerequisites & Installation

### Requirements
- **macOS** (Apple Silicon recommended)
- **Python 3.13+** (Recommended for JIT/Performance) or Python 3.11 (Supported)
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (Required for compiling custom engines like Glomap or Brush)
- **Homebrew** (for installing system dependencies like COLMAP and FFmpeg)
- **Git**

### Installation
1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/freddewitt/CorbeauSplat.git
    cd CorbeauSplat
    ```

2.  Run the launcher:
    ```bash
    ./run.command
    ```
    *The script will automatically detect missing dependencies (Python packages, Brush, SuperSplat, Rust, Node.js, etc.) and attempt to install them for you.*

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Configuration Tab**: 
    -   Select your input (Video or Folder of images).
    -   Define a **Project Name** (your files will be saved in `[Output Folder]/[Project Name]`).
    -   Click **"Create COLMAP Dataset"**.
2.  **Params Tab**: (Optional) Tweak advanced COLMAP settings or enable **Glomap**.
3.  **Upscale Tab**: (Optional)
    -   Enable **"Enable Upscale"** in the Training tab to apply upscaling during dataset creation.
    -   `upscayl-bin` is automatically downloaded and installed on first launch — no manual setup required.
    -   Choose a model (e.g., Real-ESRGAN x4+ for photos, 4xLSDIR for ultra fidelity) and configure scale, format, and tile size.
    -   Download additional models directly from the tab (4xLSDIR, 4xNomos8kSC, NMKD-Siax).
4.  **Brush Tab**: 
    -   **Auto-Refine**: Choose "Refine" mode to resume training from the latest checkpoint.
    -   **Presets**: Use specific densification strategies (e.g., "Aggressive Densification").
    -   Click **"Start Brush Training"**.
5.  **SuperSplat Tab**: 
    -   Load your trained `.ply` file.
    -   Click **"Start Servers"** to launch the viewer locally.
6.  **4DGS Tab (Experimental)**:
    -   Check **"Activate"** to install the required dependencies (Nerfstudio).
    -   Select a folder containing your synced camera videos.
    -   Click **"Start Process"** to generate a dataset ready for 4DGS training.
7.  **360 Extractor Tab (Experimental)**:
    -   **Activate**: Install the dedicated environment (PySide6, YOLOv8).
    -   **Convert**: Extract images from 360° videos with advanced layouts (Ring, Cube Map, Fibonacci).
    -   **AI Masking**: Automatically mask the operator.
8. **Apple Sharp Tab (Bonus)**:
    -   Select a single source image or a **Video**.
    -   Click **"Predict 3D Model"** or **"Start Conversion"** to generate a mesh sequence using machine learning.
